# Weather-Forecast

## About the Project
This weeks challenged involved creating a dashboard that provides weather conditions for cities by utilizing a server side API. 
The user can enter a city name and the webpage will display the given cities current weather conditions along with a 5-day forecast. Search history will be saved to the local storage for future use and display on the webpage.
